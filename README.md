# Manuscript data and code repository for "Loss of calpain3b in zebrafish, a model of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, increases susceptibility to muscle defects due to increased activity." paper

This paper ("capn3b paper" for short) involves some graphs and statistical analyses of how various treatments affect muscle structure. The relevant data and code have been compiled in the folders Figure4_data and Figure6_data

## Installation
No installation is required for the scripts in Figure4_data and Figure6_data folders, but some packages need to be installed:

- ggplot2
- dplyr
- ggsci
- psych
- vcd
- DescTools
- rcompanion

## Usage
If you want to replicate the data in the paper or use the code for your own purposes, please open the scripts and make sure that your working directory is the same one where the script is located and execute the whole script or relevant parts of it. Usage of your own data will require new data and adapting specific code lines because the factor levels were hard-coded.

## Repository structure
This repository is for the capn3b paper consists of the following parts:

- [Figure4_data](https://github.com/SergeyPry/capn3b_paper/tree/main/Figure4_data) - Data and scripts to generate the Figure 4 of the paper. 
- [Figure6_data](https://github.com/SergeyPry/capn3b_paper/tree/main/Figure6_data) - Data and scripts to generate the Figure 6 of the paper.
